            Septoria cannabis is a species of plant pathogen from the  genus Septoria that 
            causes the disease commonly known as Septoria leaf spot. Early symptoms of infection 
            are concentric white lesions on the vegetative leaves of cannabis plants,followed by 
            chlorosis and necrosis of the leaf until it is ultimately overcome by disease 
            and all living cells are then killed.

            Powdery Mildew is arguable the most destructive Cannabis pest.It is an obligate 
            biotroph that can vascularize into the plant tissue and remain invisible to a grower.
            It tends to emerge and sporulate 2 weeks into flowering thus destroying very mature crop 
            with severe economic consequences.It is believed to travel in clones and it’s is not known
            if it travels in seeds.Early detection and eradication may be the safest approach.

            TMV is a virus that is commonly found in tobacco plants which causes splotchy or twisted leaves,
            strange mottling symptoms, slowed growth, and reduced yields. TMV has spread to several other 
            species of plants besides tobacco, including cannabis plants. Plants that get infected by TMV 
            may not grow as fast or yield as well as they could have

            Spider mites are part of the mite family and are related to spiders, ticks, and other mites.
            Although they’re a common cannabis pest, they can be very difficult to get rid of 
            Spider mites have tiny sharp mouths that pierce individual plant cells and suck out the contents.
            This is what results in the tiny yellow, orange or white speckles you see on your plant leaves.
            Spider mites are common cannabis pests,especially when growing in soil. Although less common 
            in hydroponics, spider mites can show up in any setup where cannabis is being cultivated.

            Calcium deficiencies can be hard to diagnose. The leaves can have dead spots,crinkling, small 
            brown spots, stunted growth, small or distorted leaves, curled tips,and dark green around 
            the affected spots. Best way to restore is to flush your plants with clean pH neutral water,
            and then resupply the water nutrient solution.

            Magnesium deficiency will give the veins and outer edges of your plant a light 
            green-yellow color. Magnesium is a mobile nutrient and can travel from old leaves 
            to new ones. Magnesium deficiency happens when the pH level is too low. Often the 
            magnesium is present,but the roots cannot absorb it, therefore adding a magnesium 
            supplement won’t help your plants.The best way to get that magnesium absorbed is to 
            increase the pH.

                      1.REMOVE INFECTED FOLIAGE - The first step dealing with leaf septoria is removing
                        infected leaves.

                      2.IMPROVE AIR CIRCULATION - Proper air circulation is extremely important for
                        cannabis plants and plays a big role in the management of pests/diseases.

                      3.AVOID MOISTURE - Moisture is another major player in the spread and 
                        germination of fungal spores. Hence, you’ll want to avoid moisture 
                        as much as possible.

                      4.REMOVE WEEDS - Night shade and horsenettle are common hosts of Septoria 
                        lycopersici spores. Hence, make sure you run through your garden and remove
                        any weeds that could possibly host the fungus.

                      5.KEEP TRACK OF TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY - Remember that 
                        leaf septoria naturally strikes in hot, wet conditions.
                        Hence, if you’re dealing with an infection, try driving
                        down the humidity and temperature levels in your grow 
                        space (where possible).

                      6.APPLY FUNGICIDES OR NATURAL OILS - If you’re dealing 
                        with a minor case of leaf septoria, steps 1-6 might 
                       - be enough to kill the disease and stop it from spreading
                        any further. However, if you’re dealing with a more 
                        serious infection you may need to rely on some heavy-handed fungicides.

                      1.Avoid Extreme Temperature Fluctuations - Day and night temperatures 
                        should not fluctuate more than about 15°F. The optimal temperature range
                        for cannabis production lies between 68°F and 85°F, but the tighter the
                        variation, the less susceptible your crop will be to powdery mildew attacks.

                      2.Use Leaf Surface pH as a Weapon - It may be impossible to eliminate powdery 
                        mildew spores from the environment, but at least growers can make it more 
                        difficult for infections to take hold. The success of powdery mildew closely 
                        depends on the pH of the leaf surface, so raising or lowering this value can 
                        disrupt its ability to become established in the crop.

                      3.Filter Out the Problem - Most indoor cultivation sites do not circulate air
                        between individual rooms, but even closed-loop ventilation systems can perpetuate 
                        powdery mildew outbreaks by dispersing spores throughout the grow room.

                      4.With Severe Infestations, Cut Your Losses, Not the Leaves - When powdery 
                        mildew is first spotted in a crop, it makes sense to remove the affected leaves. 
                        But if none of the previous four recommendations are followed, 
                        it’s unlikely that an outbreak will improve through leaf removal alone. 
                        With heavy infestations, removing leaves can actually make the problem worse.

                      There is no cure. An infected plant will have TMV forever. 
                      Your main goal, in other words, is to find the infected plants and remove them 
                      from the grow.

                      1.Use ladybugs - Ladybugs are natural predators of spider mites, and they may
                        show up on your weed plants once a spider mite population gets underway. 
                        However, the ladybugs are likely to leave as soon as the spider mites have been 
                        eaten, so you may need to buy more ladybugs in case a new wave of spider mites,
                        such as the immature ones that survived the initial feeding frenzy, show up.

                      2.Use a vacuum cleaner - Perfect for a single Pot for Pot, get a handheld vacuum 
                        cleaner and pass it over the top and underside of all leaves of your plants.
                        Carefully transfer the contents of the vacuum bag into a plastic container that you 
                        can seal, and then put that sealed container in your freezer. The extreme cold will 
                        kill all the spider mites, and you simply throw the bag in the trash.
                        The key advantage of this method is that all the lifecycle stages 
                        (from eggs to nymphs and adults) of the spider mites will be targeted by the vacuum
                        cleaner.

                      3.Prepare homemade killing solutions - You can also mix some solutions that will kill
                        spider mites. For example, make a bleach solution containing a tablespoon of bleach in a 
                        gallon of 95°F water. Another one to try is at least three parts water with no more than seven
                        parts of alcohol. Spray this solution on your plants in the evening once temperatures
                        have dropped. Other DIY solutions include nicotine tea, homemade pepper spray and other
                        mixtures, whose recipes you can find online.

                      4.Use a commercial spray - If making DIY solutions to kill spider mites isn’t 
                        your cup of tea, or you are dealing with a serious infestation that requires 
                        decisive action, a commercially available contact spray might work more in your 
                        favor. Many of these are easy to find online, or at any agricultural supply store.
                        If you use these, make sure you are thorough. The spray is only effective on the 
                        spider mites it gets in contact with. The others will probably become resistant.

                      1.PH LEVELS IN SOIL - Growers using soil should always keep their ph levels 
                        between 6.0 and 7.0 . Calcium however, is best absorbed when the level is above 6.2,
                        so keeping the ph a bit higher than the minimum is advised.

                      2.Dolomite lime is great for those growing organic cannabis.

                      3.Fish bones, seashells, and even crushed up eggshells can help 
                        provide additional calcium to the plants over time.

                      1.FLUSH AND ADD SUPPLEMENTS - Solving a magnesium deficiency should 
                        begin with a flush of 6.0pH water. This should work fine for all substrates.
                        Next, you need to prepare a feed with the optimal pH for your growing medium. 
                        (Soil: 6.0-6.5, Coco: 6.0 and Hydro: 5.5-6.0). In addition to the usual brew of nutes,
                        add a high-quality, cannabis-specific magnesium supplement.

                      2.FLUSH AND UPGRADE NUTRIENTS - As above, rinse out the substrate.
                        But instead of adding a supplement, a better long term solution is 
                        to consider a nutrients upgrade. Specific nutrient lines customised to soil, 
                        coco or hydro grow styles make life a whole lot easier. Premier brand base-nutes
